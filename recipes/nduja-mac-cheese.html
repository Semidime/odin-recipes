                    <li>150g dried macaroni.</li>
                    <li>Maldon sea flakes.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Add macaroni to a saucepan and cover with cold water.  Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over a high heat.</li>
                    <li>Cook for approximately 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Water should be almost absorbed and the pasta not quite al dente.</li>
                    <li>Add evaporated milk, stir and bring back to the boil.</li>
                    <li>Add grated cheese, stir to combine, then add nduja. Continue to stir until combined.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to low, stirring continuously, until liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce.  At this stage the cheese should have melted completely and the nduja should be fully emulsified.</li>
                    <li>Adjust seasoning if required and serve immediately.</li>
